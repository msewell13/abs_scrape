# ABS Mobile Shift Maintenance Scraper

This repo contains a Playwright-based scraper for the ABS portal:
- `mobile_shift_maintenance_scrape.mjs`: scrapes the Mobile Shift Maintenance grid
- Sends data directly to Monday.com
- Runs automatically every 15 minutes via cron job

The scraper loads credentials from a `.env` file and saves a reusable Playwright `storageState.json` after login.

## Install

### Quick Install (All Platforms)

From this project folder:
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Features

For advanced features like scheduling and automation, see the sections below.

**Debug and Feature Flags:**
- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` to run scrapers in visible browser mode, `False` for headless mode
- `CALL_LOGGER_NOTES`: Set to `True` to log employee comments in call logger, `False` to skip this step

## Automated Scheduling (Cron Jobs)

The project includes automated scheduling capabilities for running the MSM scraper every 15 minutes.

### Quick Start

**Run MSM scraper with cron scheduler:**
```bash
npm run cron-msm         # Run MSM scraper only
```

**Install scheduled tasks:**
```bash
# Windows
npm run install-tasks    # Install Windows Task Scheduler task

# macOS/Linux
npm run install-cron-mac    # macOS
npm run install-cron-linux  # Linux
```

### Windows Task Scheduler Setup

1. **Automatic Installation:**
   ```bash
   npm run install-tasks
   ```
   This creates one scheduled task:
   - `ABS-MSM-Scraper` (Every 15 minutes)

2. **Manual Installation:**
   - Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`)
   - Create Basic Task â†’ Name: "ABS-MSM-Scraper"
   - Trigger: Daily â†’ Start time: 12:00 AM â†’ Recur every: 15 minutes
   - Action: Start a program â†’ Program: `node` â†’ Arguments: `"C:\path\to\cron_scheduler.mjs" --schedule-msm`

### macOS/Linux Cron Setup

1. **Automatic Installation:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   npm run install-cron-mac
   
   # Linux
   npm run install-cron-linux
   ```
   This creates one cron job:
   - MSM Scraper (Every 15 minutes)

2. **Manual Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Make script executable
   chmod +x cron_scheduler_mac.sh
   
   # Install cron jobs
   ./cron_scheduler_mac.sh install
   
   # View installed cron jobs
   crontab -l
   ```

3. **Manual Execution:**
   ```bash
   # Run MSM scraper manually
   ./cron_scheduler_mac.sh msm
   
   # Or using npm scripts
   npm run cron-msm-mac
   ```

### Cron Scheduler Features

- **Automatic Retries**: Failed runs are retried up to 3 times
- **Logging**: All runs are logged to `logs/cron-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **Timeout Protection**: Scripts timeout after 30 minutes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
- **Sleep Mode Handling**: Automatically wakes up computer if sleeping
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Sleep Mode Handling

The cron scheduler automatically handles computers in sleep mode:

**Windows:**
- Uses `powercfg` to prevent sleep during execution
- Windows Task Scheduler configured with `-WakeToRun` flag
- Automatically disables sleep timeouts during script execution

**macOS/Linux:**
- Uses `caffeinate` (macOS) or system commands (Linux) to wake up
- Checks system responsiveness before running scripts
- Waits 30 seconds for full system wake-up

**Wake-up Process:**
1. **Detection**: Checks if computer is responsive
2. **Wake-up**: Sends wake-up commands if needed
3. **Wait**: Allows 30 seconds for system to fully wake up
4. **Retry**: Up to 3 attempts if wake-up fails
5. **Proceed**: Runs scripts even if wake-up partially fails

### Log Files

- **Location**: `logs/cron-msm.log` and `logs/cron-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **Retention**: Last 30 days of logs kept automatically
- **Format**: `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] MESSAGE`

### Manual Execution

**Using PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Run MSM scraper manually
node .\cron_scheduler.mjs --schedule-msm

# Install Windows scheduled tasks
.\install_scheduled_tasks.ps1
```


### Run Commands

**MSM Scraper with Monday.com (recommended):**
```bash
npm run scrape-msm-monday
```

**Manual sync to Monday.com:**
```bash
npm run sync-msm-monday # Sync existing MSM data
```

**Manual run:**
- Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
node .\mobile_shift_maintenance_scrape.mjs
```

- macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)
```bash
node ./mobile_shift_maintenance_scrape.mjs
```

### Troubleshooting Scheduling

**Windows:**
- **Task not running**: Check Windows Event Viewer for Task Scheduler errors
- **Permission issues**: Run PowerShell as Administrator
- **Node not found**: Ensure Node.js is in system PATH

**macOS/Linux:**
- **Cron not running**: Check system cron service is enabled
- **Permission issues**: Ensure script is executable (`chmod +x cron_scheduler_mac.sh`)
- **Node not found**: Ensure Node.js is in system PATH
- **Cron logs**: Check system cron logs (`/var/log/cron` or `journalctl -u cron`)

**Both Platforms:**
- **Log files**: Check `logs/` directory for detailed error information
- **Environment variables**: Ensure `.env` file is properly configured
- **Blocked by WAF/Cloudflare**:
  - Run from your normal/trusted network.
- **Login issues**:
  - Verify `.env` values and that the login page still uses `#UserName` / `#Password` fields.
- **Monday.com board creation issues:**
  - If board import fails: Ensure the board is named exactly "MSM Shift Data"
  - If sync fails: Check that `MONDAY_MSM_BOARD_ID` is set correctly in `.env`
- **Partial/empty results (Mobile Shift Maintenance)**:
  - The script automatically selects all exceptions and paginates the grid.
  - Verify the date range is the last 8 days as expected.
